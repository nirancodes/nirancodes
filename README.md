# ðŸš€ Welcome to My GitHub!  

## ðŸ‘‹ About Me  
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Niranjana, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto, passionate about building high-impact software with real-world relevance.

ðŸ”§ I love solving system-level problems and designing reliable, scalable tools â€” whether it's improving drone communication networks or building intelligent, offline-first apps for public good.

ðŸ§  I work with C/C++, Python, MATLAB, and JavaScript â€” and I'm diving deeper into Linux systems, trying to learn more about the Open Source world, ROS, and cloud-native development.

ðŸš€ Some of my recent projects include:
- **AttendDetect**: a real-time employee monitoring tool using OpenCV, C++, and Windows API (now open source!)
- **MedScope**: a disaster-response vision system using PyTorch + Gemini API, built in 24h at an MLH Hackathon
- **HushAlerts**: a web-based inventory tracker tackling menstrual equity, built with JS and HTML5 Audio API

ðŸ’¡ I'm currently exploring:
- Distributed systems + simulation (drone networks, mesh topologies)
- DevOps, Open Source Softwares, containerization, and site reliability engineering (SRE)
- Real-time CV pipelines and ethical AI

ðŸ“¬ Iâ€™m always open to collaborating, contributing to open-source, and learning from other builders. Feel free to explore my repos or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niranjana-nambiar/)!
