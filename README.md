# Hi, I'm Niranjana N. Nambiar  
Second-year Computer Engineering student at UofT, building explainable AI for cyber resilience. I focus on interpretable ML, secure deployments, and ops-driven design to create real-world impact.

## About Me  
I specialize in trustworthy AI systems with a strong emphasis on security, observability, and clarity. Currently, I research cyberattack detection in smart grids (Kundur Group) and lead perception tooling for the UTFR Driverless team — developing automated cone labeling pipelines with Python and YOLOv8.

## What I Build  
- **SceneScore:** AI that maps photo moods to Spotify playlists using NLP and LLMs  
- **DroneWatch:** Real-time drone network path planning & cyber simulation with MATLAB and ACO  
- **KANs for AGC:** Symbolic ML for detecting stealthy cyberattacks in power grids
